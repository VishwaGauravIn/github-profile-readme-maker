### Branch Organization

Submit all changes directly to the main branch. We donâ€™t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep the main branch in good shape, with all tests passing.

Code that lands in the main branch must be compatible with the latest stable release. It may contain additional features, but no breaking changes. We should be able to release a new minor version from the tip of the main branch at any time.

### Prerequisites

- You have Node installed at v8.0.0+ and Yarn at v1.2.0+.
- You have JDK installed.
- You have GCC installed or are comfortable installing a compiler if needed. Some of our dependencies may require a compilation step. On OS X, the Xcode Command Line Tools will cover this. On Ubuntu, `apt-get install build-essential` will install the required packages. Similar commands should work on other Linux distros. Windows will require some additional steps; see the node-gyp installation instructions for details.
- You are familiar with Git.

### How to Report Bugs

To report bugs, you should create an issue and describe the bug properly. You can also suggest a way to fix it if you know how. You should mention your device details (if possible) so that we can find the fix faster.

### Non-Coding Contribution
